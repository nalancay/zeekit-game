In this assignment, a game is created in React called: "Guess the TV show name".

## Gameplay and rules

- The player will see a placeholder for a TV name with some missing letters. The player should guess and fill in TV show's name. If the player guesses successfully a tv show name, it gets a point and moves forward to guess another tv show name.

- The player would be able to use a hint feature in case it's stuck with a specific TV show.

- The player has a total of 3 life points. For each wrong guess, it loses a point. If the player lost all 3 points the game is over and can be started again.
